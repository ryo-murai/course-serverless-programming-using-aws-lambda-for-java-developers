Play section I want you to create to Lambda functions will create a new project where we'll have to Lambda functions these Lambda functions will be triggered by the API Gateway and they will be going against each other customers from that database earlier we have walked with order information that will create a project from scratch called customer API with individual how to Lambda functions create customer Lambda read customers Lambda of order it will help customer. Java and the fields on that customer. 
Job will be first name last name and the customers Reward Points once you have the lambdas and the polling place the next important piece is the template. I'm on file so you can take the help of the template. 

Carmel from orders API to Define to Lambda functions that will be triggered by an API Gateway event Define your Lambda function and then you will add the event which is a API Gateway event post for creaticity post and get for getting the details so you can use the outputs section at the end to display that you are as that are generated on the Fly that can be used to hit the API and for the dynamodb table you know how to create it under the resources section will create customers pay the primary key will be the customer ID although I didn't show you that on the porch or hear how a tidy for the customer which would be the primary key just like how we had ID for the order so go ahead. That work flow just like how we have done it for the order this time it be before the customer

I want you to work on a student test grading workflow or use case very well how to Lambda functions the first Lambda function will be triggered by an S3 event when the students data is uploaded to ask 3 Pocket just like before earlier we have dealt with patient data patient data case on file to S3 bucket by the first Lambda function in this case it could be the student information the student portal without roll number named test score the trade information will not come in this data you can only see how the test score if the test score is greater than 70 you can write it as grade be if it is more than 90 it is if it is less than 70 days great see three grades are good enough so that grade calculation it will do in the first Lambda and we'll set this field grade inside of up first Lambda function so this is how the world tube look like you would create a Json file which area of student details that'll be three pills here phone number name and then the test score the first clam that will be triggered it will read the student details calculate the great little update that great on the porch you object so just like the patient for Joe we have in our hands on Project let me open up the event like this it will have four Fields the wrong number to student meme then he's Max and finally the grade and the Json data comes there will be no great Universal and I will calculate the grid and said that great and then you will publish a topic that red bike report generator or I can figure out which you will be creating that guy that details into the logs so go ahead create a pojo to Landis and then you know how to create the template. Amal file that will create the entire infrastructure that is required you can refer to the patient check out project for any information
